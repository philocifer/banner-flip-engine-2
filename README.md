# Save-A-Lot Banner Flip Engine
The AI-powered Banner Flip Engine chatbot helps the Save-A-Lot business development team decide whether competitor grocery stores are banner flip opportunities. A banner flip is when a competitor store converts to a Save-A-Lot store: operating under the Save-A-Lot banner while maintaining current ownership, sourcing products from Save-A-Lot distribution centers, and conforming to Save-A-Lot store design standards.  

Users are able to interact with a competitor store database using natural language to narrow down stores that are viable. In-depth competitor store reports can be generated that analyze demographic, competitive, economic, and other factors to ensure alignment with Save-A-Lot's strategic objectives.
