Given Boca Raton's robust economic landscape, dense residential communities, and competitive grocery market, transitioning Howards Market may capitalize on untapped consumer segments. By aligning with Save-A-Lot's value-focused model, the conversion aims to enhance competitiveness against larger grocery chains, leveraging Boca Raton's economic vitality. This report assesses demographic, competitive, and operational attributes to determine the feasibility and strategic benefits of such a conversion.\n\n## Demographic and Economic Overview\n\nBoca Raton, Florida, is a promising target area for retail conversions due to its economic dynamism and stable population. The city boasts a robust median household income of $110,593, which is significantly higher than the Florida state median, indicating a higher purchasing power among residents [1]. Over the years, Boca Raton has experienced a considerable increase in income levels, evidencing ongoing economic growth [2]. \n\nThe population stability is marked by a high percentage of residents who have lived in the same home for at least a year, fostering a sense of community [3]. Moreover, the city's workforce participation is noteworthy, with a substantial portion engaged in various industries such as finance, education, and technology [4]. These demographic and economic indicators highlight Boca Raton as a suitable candidate for a Save-A-Lot conversion, likely leading to sustained retail success by leveraging the community's economic vitality.\n\n### Sources\n1.

Economic Development 2023 Annual Report - Boca Raton, Florida: https://myboca.us/DocumentCenter/View/34169/Economic-Development-2023-Annual-Report-PDF\n\n## Competitive Landscape Analysis\n\nThe grocery market in Boca Raton is notably competitive, with several established players. Howard's Market, an independent store, operates in an environment dominated by large chain supermarkets such as Publix, Aldi, Walmart, and new entrants like Whole Foods and Sprouts Farmers Market [1][2]. These competitors typically offer a wide range of products at competitive prices, benefiting from economies of scale.\n\nIn contrast, Save-A-Lot, while smaller and generally considered a discount retailer, strategically positions itself with a focus on value and a streamlined shopping experience. The retailer is expanding its customer engagement through digital transformation, including a loyalty program and micro-fulfillment centers [3][4]. This approach could allow Save-A-Lot to tap into a segment of the Boca Raton market seeking budget-friendly alternatives, potentially attracting consumers who prioritize price over brand loyalty.\n\nGiven the current competitive dynamics, a new Save-A-Lot store might appeal to cost-conscious customers and those interested in convenient grocery shopping options, potentially carving out a niche alongside traditional, larger supermarkets.\n\n### Sources\n1. https://bocaratontribune.com/bocaratonnews/2023/07/uptown-boca-welcomes-whole-foods-market/\n2. https://www.sun-sentinel.com/2024/04/27/west-bocas-supermarket-boom-a-new-publix-will-soon-join-a-cluster-of-other-big-name-grocers/\n3. https://www.grocerydive.com/news/save-a-lot-growth-discounters-bill-mayo-loyalty-app-hispanic-store-technology/738777/\n4. https://omnitalk.blog/2025/02/10/save-a-lots-bold-2025-strategy-unveiled/\n\n## Store Visibility and Accessibility\n\nHowards Market in Boca Raton is strategically located at 6060 SW 18th St. The market is part of the Village Tower Shoppes, a shopping center with prominent signage and visibility. This location is surrounded by numerous residential communities, making it easily accessible to local residents [1]. Furthermore, the presence of outstanding pylon and building signage enhances the store's visibility to passing traffic, increasing its prominence in the area.\n\nWhile specific information about public transportation options directly serving the location is limited, the convenience of the shopping center's positioning near residential zones likely facilitates pedestrian access [1]. The store's proximity to well-populated neighborhoods suggests a steady flow of walk-in customers, crucial for a grocery store relying on local foot traffic. Therefore, Howards Market benefits from both high visibility and accessibility, contributing to its successful operation as a neighborhood supermarket.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Village Tower Shoppes Restaurant For Lease, Suite 103: https://rosenfeldrealtyadvisors.com/properties/village-tower-shoppes-restaurant-for-lease-suite-103/\n\n## Physical Assessment of the Building\n\nThe exterior of Howard's Market, situated at 6060 SW 18th St, Boca Raton, is strategically located within the Village Tower Shoppes, benefiting from exposure to affluent neighborhoods, which aligns with Save-A-Lot's demand for accessible and visible locations [1]. Renovations ongoing until 2025 present a potential for the market to further adapt to Save-A-Lot\u2019s contemporary design standards. This transition phase may temporarily affect the store's ability to fully match the modern aesthetic sought by Save-A-Lot [1].\n\nInternally, Howard's Market spans 10,000 square feet with three checkout lanes, offering sufficient space for conventional supermarket operations [2]. Save-A-Lot's focus on efficient, modern layouts suggests the necessity for enhancements such as better lighting and optimized shelf arrangements to align with their standards [2]. These modifications can improve the store\u2019s functional appeal and operational efficiency, thus strengthening its alignment with Save-A-Lot\u2019s branding and customer expectations [2]. Overall, strategic updates would enhance Howard's Market compatibility with Save-A-Lot\u2019s preferred aesthetic and operational standards.\n\n### Sources\n[1] 6060 SW 18 St, Boca Raton, FL 33433 - Village Tower Shoppes - LoopNet: https://www.loopnet.com/Listing/6060-SW-18-St-Boca-Raton-FL/32159269/  \n[2] Save A Lot Completes Wholesale Model Transition: https://progressivegrocer.com/save-lot-completes-wholesale-model-transition  \n\n## Ownership and Management Considerations\n\nHoward's Market, situated at 6060 SW 18th St, Boca Raton, FL, operates as an independent grocery store under the ownership of Howard Adkin. This independence offers agility in decision-making, but may limit access to financial resources compared to larger grocery chains. Converting to a Save-A-Lot model presents strategic opportunities, such as benefiting from Save-A-Lot's support systems and financial incentives [1][2]. The transition could prove advantageous by providing training, minimizing certain expenses, and potentially improving profitability while preserving some operational independence [3].\n\nGiven Mr. Adkin's independent ownership, any negotiations about converting to Save-A-Lot should consider his vision for the market and its growth potential. Engaging Mr. Adkin directly is crucial to understand his willingness to adopt the Save-A-Lot model, which could provide competitive advantages in a market that includes major players like Publix. Contact details and business information suggest that direct communication with Mr. Adkin might facilitate discussions on this potential transformation [4].\n\n### Sources\n[1] Howard's Market | BBB Business Profile - Better Business Bureau: https://www.bbb.org/us/fl/boca-raton/profile/grocery-store/howards-market-0633-90287442  \n[2] Convert Your Store With Our Grocery Store Licensing Model - Save A Lot: https://ownasavealot.com/blog/convert-your-existing-store-with-our-grocery-store-licensing-model/  \n[3] Four Advantages of Opening a Grocery Store With Us - Save A Lot: https://ownasavealot.com/blog/four-advantages-of-opening-a-grocery-store-with-us/  \n[4] Howard Adkin (8 matches): Phone Number, Email, Address - Spokeo: https://www.spokeo.com/Howard-Adkin  \n\n## Financial Viability\n\nHoward's Market in Boca Raton is an independent grocery store with annual sales of $5.2 million, well within its $4 to $6 million sales range. The store occupies 10,000 square feet and employs 50 full-time workers, indicating a modest operational scale [1]. It is important to examine potential financial distress indicators; however, the absence of declining sales and the presence of strong supplier relationships suggest relative financial stability at present.\n\nThe store's supplier, SuperValu, provides a solid supply chain foundation. SuperValu is a longstanding grocery wholesaler, now part of United Natural Foods, offering diversified resources and efficient service to independent grocers like Howard's Market [2][3]. This partnership is a strong point for maintaining consistency in inventory and pricing, crucial for financial health.\n\nThere are no significant signs of distress, such as declining revenue or inconsistent cash flow, which are critical early indicators [4][5]. Thus, Howard's Market appears financially viable and potentially a good investment opportunity, focusing on stable operations and robust supply logistics.\n\n### Sources\n[1] Source: HOWARD'S MARKET in Boca Raton, FL | Company Info & Reviews - Bizapedia: https://www.bizapedia.com/fl/howards-market.html\n[2] Source: SUPERVALU Acquires Associated Grocers of Florida for $180M - Abasto: https://abasto.com/en/news/supervalu-acquires-associated-grocers-of-florida/\n[3] Source: SuperValu (United States) - Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperValu_(United_States)\n[4] Source: How to Recognise Signs of Financial Distress: https://blog.companywatch.net/resources/how-to-recognise-signs-of-financial-distress\n[5] Source: Financial Distress: Recognizing Early Warning Signs: https://www.sdmayer.com/resources/financial-distress\n\n## Conclusion and Recommendations\n\nThrough our comprehensive analysis, it emerges that Howards Market in Boca Raton is well-suited for a transition to a Save-A-Lot outlet.
